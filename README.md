Project Oil Spills:
The goal of this project was to animate a beautiful physical phenomenon that combined different branches of physics. We decided to create a fluid and optics simulation of a dynamic oil layer. 

Methods:
To achieve this result, we combined different numerical techniques for each physical processes. 
Hydrodynamics: We discretized the advection-diffusion differential equation in two dimensions to solve for solve for the density of oil as a function of position and time. We used a simple finite difference scheme to evolve our solution. As for the advection part, we introduced a temporally constant velocity field to displace the oil layer and make it more dynamic
Optics: We first derived a mathematical relation that gives the wavelength with maximum constructive interference for a given observation angle and film layer thickness. We then mapped the density to a layer thickness, from which we calculated the color at each pixel.

Results:
See video files. We have different initial conditions for the oil density.
1.	Thin layer generated by a superposition of sinusoidal waves with noisy phases and amplitudes.
2.	Fixed droplets of oil 
3.	Raining droplets of oil 
4.	Input drawing by the user with the mouse
